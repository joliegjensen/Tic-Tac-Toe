# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description
Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe! This is a new rendition of the beloved game! Code was developed by MITxPro.

## How To Run
1. Clone the files from the repository
2. Double-click the 'index.html' file to open!

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
Some features that I'd like to add include:
* A "Reset" button that appears once the game is concluded, rather than making players refresh the page
* Some kind of way to keep score between players (maybe some kind of table with the players' names, that adds a tally mark to their side each time they win).
* I'd also love to make some updates to the appearance of the program!
